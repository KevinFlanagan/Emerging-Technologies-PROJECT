# Emerging-Technologies-PROJECT

### Project for Emerging Technologies by Kevin Flanagan G00228079

(1) Jupyter notebook with a trains model that shows its accuracy.

(2) Python script that runs a web service on the model.

(3) Dockerfile to build and run web service container.

(4) Set-up git repo and ReadMe. 

Requirements of the project: 

Create a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set.

 * Jupyter notebook that trains a model using a data set.
 
Develop a web service that will display the pridicted power value based 0on speed values sent using a HTTP request

  * Web service based on train model using python.
  * Use a container to build and run the web service. (Dockerfile)
